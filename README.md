# Project Nicholas

## Project Description

The app is a shoe reselling website where buyers and sellers of hyped up shoes can come together and buy/sell brand new shoes. Sellers are able to create accounts and list their shoes onto the marketplace for anyone to buy, and buyers are able to make accounts to buy shoes. Users are able to view their own profile, which consists of all their past purchases of shoes, their past sales of shoes, and what they have currently listed on the webpage.

## Development

The app is a full stack MERN application, meaning it was coded using MongoDB, ExpressJS, React.js and Node.js. The programming languages used in this app were Javascript, HTMl and CSS. The framework used in this project is the ExpressJS framework, a Node.js framework used to build the backend of this app. The library used in this project is the React library, used to code the frontend client of the webpage.
As for the overall code design, the application followed a Client-Server model, where the React frontend acted as the client that sends requests to the Express server, which then interacted with the MongoDB database. The Express backend acted as a RESTful API to serve data to the frontend. Also, the React frontend took advantage of components to produce reusable structures that led to an efficient webpage. Also, JWT was used in order to ensure secure user authentication and authorization checks.

## Installation for your Software/System
